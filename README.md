The librarian interacting with the system should be easily able to do the work. The formed system should be hard to operate.

The system should be valid only to the members of the library. The scholars (students) should only be able to search for a particular book. Only the members can change or alter other information.

To notify the user, the mobile should be able to vibrate or make a flash. The first one is applicable only when the mobile is with the user. The second one is applicable when the user is not carrying a mobile phone.

The application should be easy to use for the user.

If the AI detects heavy traffic sounds or loud noises it should automatically send a message to the guardian of the user just to ensure his/her safety. 

The vibrations and the flash light should be strong enough and would only stop when the user views the notification.

It would be better if the application works with using cellular data.
The application should not take too long to open.
